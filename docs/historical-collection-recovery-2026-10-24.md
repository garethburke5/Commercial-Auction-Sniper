# Historical collection recovery — 24 October 2026

## Scope and acceptance

The programme covers individual auction appearances across UK auction houses, branches and trading names, for every property sector and the preceding twenty years. Retain older evidence too. Catalogue discovery, successful collection attempts and source-label counts are not proof of national completeness.

Keep guide and achieved prices distinct. Preserve sold prior, sold after, unsold, withdrawn and postponed outcomes; never manufacture missing prices. Preserve original evidence and separate changed legal interests when matching properties.

## Implemented recovery

- The historical workflow runs hourly with a 20-minute rotating collection budget, a per-task timeout, and a single concurrency group. It no longer stops after four fast tasks.
- A rebuild-only workflow mode publishes already banked evidence without waiting for another collection batch.
- The rotation contains 52 collection tasks, including the previously omitted Barnard Marcus continuation. This is a task count, not a count of distinct auction houses.
- Every attempt records its outcome, elapsed time and diagnostic tail. Cursor checkpoints survive failed tasks.
- Symonds & Sampson reads its official XML sitemap and property pages, retains disappeared pages, and checkpoints successful lot records individually.
- Swift retains validated dated lot cards when the catalogue headline count disagrees, while keeping the catalogue incomplete.
- Barnard Marcus discovers dated catalogues from its official sitemap, prioritises missing catalogues, reuses reconciled legacy captures, checkpoints API pages, retains individually identified rows despite inconsistent totals, and recovers omitted identities from official detail pages.
- Incomplete source-corpus catalogues now produce explicit coverage-gap records. A stored lot cannot silently make an incomplete catalogue disappear from monitoring.
- Source-corpus banking preserves sold-prior and sold-after outcomes. Barnard Marcus and Pugh unsold parsing cannot treat the substring “sold” as a sale.
- `data/auction_history/source_register.json` records external directory discovery, conservative links to corpus labels, retained years and price counts, collector failures and incomplete catalogues. Directory entries require UK geography, branch and trading-name reconciliation before they can serve as a national denominator.

## Measured checkpoints

The pre-recovery production checkpoint at 16:14 UTC contained 279,143 individual lot records, 1,868 reconciled retained catalogues and 621 incomplete or unreconciled catalogue states. It included future auctions and must not be described as 279,143 historical properties or unique buildings.

The local database rebuild at 21:24 UTC passed SQLite integrity checking and contained 279,503 appearances: 341 newly captured Barnard Marcus October lots, 12 Symonds & Sampson records and 7 Swift records above that baseline. This is a local recovery checkpoint; production publication must be verified separately. The subsequent 21:28 UTC rebuild contained 279,507 appearances after recovering all four missing sitemap identities. The 364 additional records and their evidence were committed in `4a7dc9227f2f5a9bf749ab68bea1462f9e071fb6`. Production rebuilding was still pending at that point.

The official Barnard Marcus October API returned conflicting totals of 345 and 347 with overlapping page results. The initial 341 captured identities therefore did not establish catalogue completeness. The sitemap supplied four further identities, all recovered from their official detail pages; the final 345 captured rows match that sitemap but the API's conflicting 347 count remains unresolved.

## Remaining programme

1. Reconcile directory identities against the source registry; do not equate 567 directory entries with 567 active UK auction houses.
2. Resolve recorded collection failures, including blocked archive pages and retired or redirected domains, source by source.
3. Reconcile each retained catalogue against its published lot inventory and investigate every shortfall.
4. Extend each auctioneer backwards through all available years, including Savills before the modern catalogue platform. Existing 2013 rows alone do not prove complete 2013 coverage.
5. Quantify missing dates, addresses, guides, achieved prices and rental evidence separately; unavailable evidence remains explicitly unavailable.
6. Verify downstream timelines, exact versus related-interest matching and publication. A rebuilt historical corpus is not itself proof that every record is visible on the public property page.

Do not mark the national programme complete until auctioneer coverage and available source-by-source catalogue inventories reconcile. No completion date has been established for inaccessible or undiscovered historical sources.

## Consolidated recovery checkpoint

The 21:49 UTC local rebuild contained 279,698 records, 555 above the 16:14 production checkpoint. Individually checked additions: Barnard Marcus 345, Bond Wolfe 175, Harman Healy 13, Swift 7, Symonds & Sampson 12 and Anderson & Garland 3. These are lot/result records, not unique buildings or a claim that every added record is dated historical evidence. Symonds includes future/undated listings; Anderson selected results can lack dates.

Harman Healy reconciled 1,520 retained cards across 31 pages after invalidating cached pagination when its total changes. This establishes the retained 2020–2026 grid, not twenty-year completeness. Anderson & Garland checked 49 retained listing URLs, retained 29 selected results, and enriched four records with exact auction dates. Successful and failed detail checks now checkpoint so bounded runs can resume.

The first widened production run attempted 45 tasks in 20 minutes: 36 completed, eight failed and one timed out. It found 39 new Cottons appearances, one Pugh appearance, seven Swift records and twelve Symonds records, and downloaded a 175-lot Bond Wolfe source file. Its publication failed on concurrent generated-file conflicts. Its artifact path also exposed a stale single-file database backup after failure; do not use that artifact as evidence of the newly collected count.

Publication now preserves a uniquely named recovery branch before rebasing, stages all historical source-corpus JSON files, banks those files before rebuilding, rebuilds again if main contributes additional source records, and restores the new oversized database before artifact upload even when publication fails. A rebuild-only mode avoids another collection delay when publishing already saved records. Retained failed checkpoint branches require reconciliation, not deletion of their evidence.

The existing hourly Auction History Capture research automation was resumed on 24 October with the all-auctioneer scope and instructions to improve actual collection, recover publication checkpoints, investigate uncovered sources/years and verify persisted output. Other paused automations were left alone. The GitHub collector is separately scheduled hourly; neither schedule establishes national completeness.

## Barnett Ross October 2016 recovery finding

The official October 2016 result page still exposes 54 individual result rows with
address text and outcomes. The saved zero-row state is a parser defect, not an
empty catalogue: each published lot label begins with Unicode byte-order mark
\`U+FEFF\`, so the otherwise valid labels \`1\` through \`54\` fail the strict
lot-number regular expression before identity construction.

The safe repair is to remove \`U+FEFF\` from the extracted lot-label cell before
applying \`LOT_RE\`, with a regression fixture using the UTF-8 byte sequence
\`EF BB BF 31\`. This normalization was reproduced independently: the raw label
fails the current expression and the normalized label passes it. A recovery run
must then reconcile exactly 54 distinct appearances and bank them as address
records with their published result states. The source publishes only “October
2016”, so \`auction_date\` must remain null unless separate exact-day evidence is
recovered; no day may be inferred from the month-only archive URL. This repair is
queued until the active generated-data publication run has finished, avoiding a
second collector or concurrent writes.
