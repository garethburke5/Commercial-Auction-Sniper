# Historical collection recovery — 24 October 2026

## Scope and acceptance

The programme covers individual auction appearances across UK auction houses, branches and trading names, for every property sector and the preceding twenty years. Retain older evidence too. Catalogue discovery, successful collection attempts and source-label counts are not proof of national completeness.

Keep guide and achieved prices distinct. Preserve sold prior, sold after, unsold, withdrawn and postponed outcomes; never manufacture missing prices. Preserve original evidence and separate changed legal interests when matching properties.

## Implemented recovery

- The historical workflow runs hourly with a 20-minute rotating collection budget, a per-task timeout, and a single concurrency group. It no longer stops after four fast tasks.
- The rotation contains 52 collection tasks, including the previously omitted Barnard Marcus continuation. This is a task count, not a count of distinct auction houses.
- Every attempt records its outcome, elapsed time and diagnostic tail. Cursor checkpoints survive failed tasks.
- Symonds & Sampson reads its official XML sitemap and property pages, retains disappeared pages, and checkpoints successful lot records individually.
- Swift retains validated dated lot cards when the catalogue headline count disagrees, while keeping the catalogue incomplete.
- Barnard Marcus discovers dated catalogues from its official sitemap, prioritises missing catalogues, reuses reconciled legacy captures, checkpoints API pages, retains individually identified rows despite inconsistent totals, and recovers omitted identities from official detail pages.
- Incomplete source-corpus catalogues now produce explicit coverage-gap records. A stored lot cannot silently make an incomplete catalogue disappear from monitoring.
- Source-corpus banking preserves sold-prior and sold-after outcomes. Barnard Marcus and Pugh unsold parsing cannot treat the substring “sold” as a sale.
- `data/auction_history/source_register.json` records external directory discovery, conservative links to corpus labels, retained years and price counts, collector failures and incomplete catalogues. Directory entries require UK geography, branch and trading-name reconciliation before they can serve as a national denominator.

## Measured checkpoints

The pre-recovery production checkpoint at 16:14 UTC contained 279,143 individual lot records, 1,868 reconciled retained catalogues and 621 incomplete or unreconciled catalogue states. It included future auctions and must not be described as 279,143 historical properties or unique buildings.

The local database rebuild at 21:24 UTC passed SQLite integrity checking and contained 279,503 appearances: 341 newly captured Barnard Marcus October lots, 12 Symonds & Sampson records and 7 Swift records above that baseline. This is a local recovery checkpoint; production publication must be verified separately. Further sitemap recovery and production collection were still running when this note was written.

The official Barnard Marcus October API returned conflicting totals of 345 and 347 with overlapping page results. The initial 341 captured identities therefore did not establish catalogue completeness. The sitemap supplied four further identities to investigate.

## Remaining programme

1. Reconcile directory identities against the source registry; do not equate 567 directory entries with 567 active UK auction houses.
2. Resolve recorded collection failures, including blocked archive pages and retired or redirected domains, source by source.
3. Reconcile each retained catalogue against its published lot inventory and investigate every shortfall.
4. Extend each auctioneer backwards through all available years, including Savills before the modern catalogue platform. Existing 2013 rows alone do not prove complete 2013 coverage.
5. Quantify missing dates, addresses, guides, achieved prices and rental evidence separately; unavailable evidence remains explicitly unavailable.
6. Verify downstream timelines, exact versus related-interest matching and publication. A rebuilt historical corpus is not itself proof that every record is visible on the public property page.

Do not mark the national programme complete until auctioneer coverage and available source-by-source catalogue inventories reconcile. No completion date has been established for inaccessible or undiscovered historical sources.
